Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Bootstrap::ShareDir::Dist

This module is the logical intersection of "ShareDir" and
"Bootstrap::lib" plug-ins.

    [Bootstrap::lib]

    [Bootstrap::ShareDir::Dist]
    dir = share

    [ShareDir]
    dir = share

The only significant difference between this module and "ShareDir" is
this module exists to make "share" visible to plugins for the
distribution being built, while "ShareDir" exists to export the "share"
directory visible after install time.

Additionally, there are two primary attributes that are provided by
"Dist::Zilla::Role::Bootstrap", See "ATTRIBUTES" in
Dist::Zilla::Role::Bootstrap

For instance, this bootstraps "ROOT/Your-Dist-Name-$VERSION/share" if it
exists and there's only one $VERSION, otherwise it falls back to simply
bootstrapping "ROOT/share"

    [Bootstrap::ShareDir::Dist]
    dir = share
    try_built = 1
