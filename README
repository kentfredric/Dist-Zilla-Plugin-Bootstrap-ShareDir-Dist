NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Bootstrap::ShareDir::Dist - Use a "share" directory
    on your dist during bootstrap

VERSION
    version 0.1.1

SYNOPSIS
    This module is the logical intersection of "ShareDir" and
    "Bootstrap::lib" plug-ins.

        [Bootstrap::lib]

        [Bootstrap::ShareDir::Dist]
        dir = share

        [ShareDir]
        dir = share

    The only difference between this module and "ShareDir" is this module
    exists to make "share" visible to plugins for the distribution being
    built, while "ShareDir" exists to export the "share" directory visible
    after install time.

METHODS
  "do_bootstrap_sharedir"
    This is where all the real work is done, and its called via a little
    glue around "plugin_from_config"

ATTRIBUTES
  "dir"
