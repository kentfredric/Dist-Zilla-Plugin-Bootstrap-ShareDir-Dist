=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Bootstrap::ShareDir::Dist - Use a share directory on your dist during bootstrap

=head1 VERSION

version 1.001002

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module allows one to load a C<Dist> styled C<ShareDir> using a C<Bootstrap>
mechanism so a distribution can use files in its own source tree when building with itself.

This is very much like the C<Bootstrap::lib> plugin in that it injects libraries into
C<@INC> based on your existing source tree, or a previous build you ran.

And it is syntactically like the C<ShareDir> plugin.

B<Note> that this is really only useful for self consuming I<plugins> and will have no effect
on the C<test> or C<run> phases of your dist. ( For that, you'll need C<Test::File::ShareDir> ).

=head1 USAGE

    [Bootstrap::lib]

    [Bootstrap::ShareDir::Dist]
    dir = share

    [ShareDir]
    dir = share

The only significant difference between this module and C<ShareDir> is this module exists to make C<share> visible to
plugins for the distribution being built, while C<ShareDir> exists to export the C<share> directory visible after install time.

Additionally, there are two primary attributes that are provided by L<< C<Dist::Zilla::Role::Bootstrap>|Dist::Zilla::Role::Bootstrap >>, See L<< Dist::Zilla::Role::Bootstrap/ATTRIBUTES >>

For instance, this bootstraps C<ROOT/Your-Dist-Name-$VERSION/share> if it exists and there's only one C<$VERSION>,
otherwise it falls back to simply bootstrapping C<ROOT/share>

    [Bootstrap::ShareDir::Dist]
    dir = share
    try_built = 1
